# otw-natas
This is a capture-the-flag type cybersecurity/hacking challenge hosted at [overthewire](https://github.com/mikelty/otw-natas.git).
Inspired by [John Hammond's Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CT7ujrwtnsM&list=PL1H1sBF1VAKWM3wMCn6H5Ql6OrgIivt2V), I used Python to solve the levels.
I also looked at [axcheron's tutorials](https://axcheron.github.io/writeups/otw/natas/) for help.
Currently, this repo solves up to level 30 (three more to go).
